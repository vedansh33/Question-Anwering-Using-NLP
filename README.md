# Question-Anwering-Using-NLP

# Description 

Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.

# Dataset 

Used Squad dataset for this task.Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

# Procedure 

1) Used SQUAD dataset to train a DIstilBert  transformer  with a span classification head .

2) DistilBert tokenizer for tokenization  using Hugging Face library
